============================

This file documents important user-visible changes in Lepton EDA.  For
more information, please consult the `ChangeLog` file.


Notable changes since Lepton EDA 1.9.5
--------------------------------------

### Changes in `lepton-schematic`:

- A new configuration key `text-sizes` in `schematic.gui` group
has been added. It can be set to a semicolon-separated list of
text size values. That values will appear in 'add text' and
'edit text' dialogs instead of the default built-ins.

- The middle mouse button can now be used to display the popup
menu. Set `(middle-button "popup")` in `gschemrc` configuration
file.

- The maximum number of recent files to show in `File â†’ Open Recent`
menu can now be configured using `max-recent-files` key in
`schematic.gui` group.

- Processing of `-q` (`--quiet`) command line option has been fixed.

### Changes in `lepton-netlist`:

- `lepton-netlist --list-backends` standard output now contains just
the list of backend names, making it more script-friendly.


Notable changes in Lepton EDA 1.9.5
-----------------------------------

### Changes when building from source:
- The version of the `libleptonrenderer` library, mistakenly
  broken in the previous release, has been fixed.

- Fixed build on systems with several versions of `guile` package
  installed. On such systems, the user can specify the right
  program binary on the `configure` stage, e.g., `./configure
  GUILE=/usr/bin/guile-2.0`.

### Changes in `lepton-schematic`:

- Log window scrolling has been fixed so that the last line of the
  log is shown correctly.

### Changes in `lepton-netlist`:

- A new backend, *tEDAx*, aimed to support for the `pcb-rnd`
  program, has been added.

- The patch preventing using of some `bash`-specific constructs
  has been applied.

- Duplicate backend name output by the `--list-backends` command
  line option has been avoided.
