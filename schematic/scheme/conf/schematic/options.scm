; Bus ripper controls
; The following keywords control the auto bus ripper addition code
;
; bus-ripper-size  : Sets the size of the auto bus rippers.
; bus-ripper-type  : Sets the bus ripper type either a "component" or
;                    plain "net"
; bus-ripper-symname  : If above is set to component, specify the symbol name.
;                       The symbol must exist in a component library
; bus-ripper-rotation  : Either "symmetric" or "non-symmetric".  This deals
;                        with how the bus ripper symbol is rotated when it
;                        is auto added to a schematic.

; reset-component-library
;
; When reset-component-library is executed, then all known component library
; paths are erased.  This is useful if the user wants to override all the
; system provided paths and provide his/her own set.  Normally this is not
; commented in.

; reset-source-library

; When reset-source-library is executed, then all known source library
; paths are erased.  This is useful if the user wants to override all the
